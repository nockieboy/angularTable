# angularTable
A simple first attempt at a git repository and an experiment with angularJS - pretty basic stuff!

This is based upon a tutorial from W3Schools (I think) but I have modified it to allow the editing of full details for each entry, deleting entries as well as creating them, additional data for each entry and the ability to order the results in ascending or descending order for each column, by clicking on the column headers.
